# pangea-ai-chat-cloudflare

An example webapp on Cloudflare demonstrating Pangea's [AI Guard][] and
[Prompt Guard][] services.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js v22.
- A [Pangea account][Pangea signup] with AI Guard, Prompt Guard, AuthN, and
  Secure Audit Log enabled.
- A Cloudflare account.
- A Google Drive folder containing spreadsheets.

  - Note down the ID of the folder for later (see [the LangChain docs][retrieve-the-google-docs]
    for a guide on how to get the ID from the URL).
  - Each spreadsheet should be named after a user and have two rows. For example:

    Alice PTO

    | Employee | Hours |
    | -------- | ----- |
    | Alice    | 25    |

    Bob PTO

    | Employee | Hours |
    | -------- | ----- |
    | Bob      | 100   |

- Two Google Identities (e.g. Alice and Bob)
  - One user (e.g. Alice) will act as the admin and own the folder and have full
    access to all spreadsheets within
  - The other user (e.g. Bob) will act as an employee with read access to their
    single spreadsheet
- A Google Cloud project with the [Google Drive API][] and [Google Sheets API][] enabled.
- A Google service account:
  1. In your Google Cloud project, go to IAM & Admin > Service Accounts (using
     the navigation menu in the top left) and create a new service account.
  2. On the service accounts page, select your new service account, click KEYS,
     and add a new key. Save the key as `credentials.json` somewhere.
  3. Share the Google Drive folder with the service accountâ€™s email, granting it
     Editor access so it can query file permissions as needed.

## Setup

### Pangea AuthN

After activating AuthN:

1. Under AuthN > General> Signup Settings, enable "Allow Signups". This way
   users won't need to be manually added.
2. For development only: under AuthN > General > Redirect (Callback) Settings,
   add `http://localhost:3000` as a redirect.
3. Under AuthN > General > Social (OAuth), enable Google.
4. Under AuthN > Overview, note the "Client Token" and "Hosted Login" values for
   later.

### Cloudflare Vectorize

```
npx wrangler vectorize create pangea-ai-chat --dimensions=768 --metric=cosine
```

### Repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/pangeacyber/pangea-ai-chat-cloudflare.git
cd pangea-ai-chat-cloudflare
npm ci
cp .dev.vars.example .dev.vars
```

There are several values that need to be filled out in `.dev.vars`:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_PANGEA_CLIENT_TOKEN`: This should be the AuthN "Client Token"
  that was noted earlier.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTHN_UI_URL`: This should be the AuthN "Hosted Login" that was
  noted earlier.
- `PANGEA_SERVICE_TOKEN`: Pangea API token with access to AI Guard and Prompt
  Guard.
- `PANGEA_AUDIT_CONFIG_ID`: Pangea Secure Audit Log configuration ID.
- `GOOGLE_DRIVE_CREDENTIALS`: Google service account credentials as a compacted
  JSON object. The value of this variable should be the contents of the
  `credentials.json` from earlier with its whitespace removed until it fits in a
  single line.
- `GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID`: Google Drive folder ID.
- `INGEST_TOKEN`: A randomly-generated value that will be the API token
  necessary for initiating ingestion of new vectors.

## Usage

A development version of the app can be started with:

```
npm run dev
```

Then navigate to <http://localhost:3000>.
